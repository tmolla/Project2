Project 2

Our idea behind this project was to design an app to help people share produce from their garden. 
We wanted to build a "farmers market" style of app.
Not only did we want to build an app for sharing produce from their garden, but also encourage people to have a garden of their own.

In order to run the app you must-- 
Clone Repository
In MySql, add schema and seeds.
Run basic NPM install.
Under config.js replace "root" with your passwords/info.
